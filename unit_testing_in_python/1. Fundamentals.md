# UNIT TESTING FUNDAMENTALS

A unit is a piece of code. It can be - 
- a function or method
- a class or module
- a small group of related classes

An automated test is designed and created by a human to test a unit. This test runs without any intervention and returns `pass` or `failed`.

When unit tests are shared between developers working on the same project, it can help in verifying that the new changes don't interfere badly with the existing development.

A unit test must not use - 

1. Filesystem
2. Database
3. Network
4. Or any other external slow kind of resource

## Test Case

A test case is a fundamental idea of unit testing. It should exercise a unit of code and should run independently of all other test cases as many times as you like. There may be several test cases exercising the same unit but each one should be independent i.e. it should not have any side effects that the other test relies on. For example it should not create any test data which any subsequent tests use. 

A test case is defined completely independently of how it will be run. 

**Test Suite** is simply a collection of test cases that are run together.

## Example 1 : Phonebook 

The task is to implement a phonebook given a list of names and phone numbers. Phonebook should be able to look up a name and return the respective phone number.
Also it should be consistent : 
- Two names can not have same phone numbers.
- No number is a prefix of another. 
- Bob : 91123453, Emergency : 911 - `Bob` and `Emergency` are  inconsistent. 

Lets begin by writing a test to test the lookup functionality. 

    import unittest
    
    class TestPhoneBook(unittest.TestCase):
        def test_lookup_by_name(self):
            phonebook = PhoneBook()
            phonebook.add("Bob", "12345")
            number = phonebook.lookup("Bob")
            self.assertEqual("12345", number)

Running the above test using `python -m unittest` gives the following result  : 

```
E
======================================================================
ERROR: test_lookup_by_name (test_phonebook.TestPhoneBook)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/mnt/Study/pythonStudy/unit_testing/test_phonebook.py", line 16, in test_lookup_by_name
    phonebook = PhoneBook()
NameError: name 'PhoneBook' is not defined

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.000s

FAILED (errors=1)

```

Now it is time to implement the `PhoneBook` class. 

```
class PhoneBook:
    def __init__(self):
        self.numbers = {}

    def add(self, name, number):
        self.numbers[name] = number

    def lookup(self, name):
        return self.numbers[name]
```

Now running the test returns `pass`. 
Lets add more test cases. 

```
    def test_missing_name(self):
        phonebook = PhoneBook()
        with self.assertRaises(KeyError):
            phonebook.lookup("missing")
```

### Setup and Teardown

Setup and teardown are what we call `test fixtures`. These methods help in overriding the behaviour of your tests. `Test fixture` in general is a piece of supporting code for the test cases.

`setUp` is called before every test method to setup any resource which can be used independently in each test method. 

`tearDown` is called after the execution of every test method. It is used to release any resources that might have been reserved in the setup or the test method.

**Order of Execution** - `setUp --> test method --> tearDown`

Even if test method throws an exception, `tearDown` will still be executed to clear the resources. If exception occurs in `setUp`, both test method and `tearDown` will not be called.

**Test case name** - Name of the test case is a headline summarising the what the test case is about. Reading the test case name should give an understanding of the behaviour of the unit under test.

**Three parts of a test** - Arrange, Act, Assert
- Arrange : Setup the object to be tested and collaborators.
- Act : Exercise the unit under test.
- Assert : Make claims about what happened. 
- Arrange can have several lines of code. Act is typically one line.
- Assert is also typically one line. Normally you only need to test one behaviour of the unit in a test case. It should have only one reason to fail and one thing for you to fix when the unit test fails.

Now lets add `setUp` and  `tearDown` test fixtures along with some more test cases to test consistency of the phonebook. 

The test module looks like - 
```
class TestPhoneBook(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.phonebook = PhoneBook()

    def tearDown(self):
        pass

    def test_lookup_by_name(self):
        self.phonebook.add("Bob", "12345")
        number = self.phonebook.lookup("Bob")
        self.assertEqual("12345", number)

    def test_missing_name(self):
        with self.assertRaises(KeyError):
            self.phonebook.lookup("missing")

    def test_empty_phonebook_is_consistent(self):
        self.assertTrue(self.phonebook.is_consistent())

    def test_is_consistent_with_different_entries(self):
        self.phonebook.add("Bob", "12345")
        self.phonebook.add("Sue", "19112")
        self.assertTrue(self.phonebook.is_consistent())

    def test_is_consistent_with_same_entries(self):
        self.phonebook.add("Bob", "98910")
        self.phonebook.add("Sue", "98910")
        self.assertFalse(self.phonebook.is_consistent())

    def test_is_consistent_with_same_prefix(self):
        self.phonebook.add("Bob", "12111")
        self.phonebook.add("Sue", "121")
        self.assertFalse(self.phonebook.is_consistent())
```

The `PhoneBook` class itself - 

```
class PhoneBook:
    def __init__(self):
        self.numbers = {}

    def add(self, name, number):
        self.numbers[name] = number

    def lookup(self, name):
        return self.numbers[name]

    def is_consistent(self):
        for name1, number1 in self.numbers.items():
            for name2, number2 in self.numbers.items():
                if name1 == name2:
                    continue
                if number1.startswith(number2):
                    return False

        return True
```
