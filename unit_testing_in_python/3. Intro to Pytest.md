## Why pytest ?

The module `unittest` came out in 2001 as a port of `JUnit` testing framework. At that time, these ports in different languages became popular and came to be known as `XUnit` testing framework. 

Over time, both `JUnit` and `unittest` have evolved. The way of writing tests with `unittest` is stylistically not very pythonic. Firstly, it is quite wordy. You will need to have a class, inherit from `unittest.TestCase` to write the tests. It predates some of the most important `PEP 8` style guides since it was designed to be like the `JUnit` framework.

`pytest` as an alternative to `unittest` is more native to the python language. It is not a member of `XUnit` family.

## Example - PhoneBook

This is similar to the `PhoneBook` class in the `fundamentals`. 
But now the `pytest` module is used instead of `unittest`.
```
def test_lookup_by_name():
    phonebook = PhoneBook()
    phonebook.add("Bob", "122323")
    assert "122323" == phonebook.lookup("Bob")
```

As you can see above there is no need of a class, even any imports and it is more concise than the same test written in `unittest`.

Obviously running the above using `python -m pytest` gives the following result -

```
_____________________________ test_lookup_by_name ______________________________

    def test_lookup_by_name():
>       phonebook = PhoneBook()
E       NameError: name 'PhoneBook' is not defined

test_pytest_phonebook.py:2: NameError
====================== 1 failed, 6 passed in 0.08 seconds ======================
```

Now lets write the skeleton code of the `PhoneBook` class.

```
class PhoneBook:
    def add(self, name, number):
        pass

    def lookup(self, name):
        pass
```

Now running pytest gives the following result : 

```
   def test_lookup_by_name():
        phonebook = PhoneBook()
        phonebook.add("Bob", "122323")
>       assert "122323" == phonebook.lookup("Bob")
E       AssertionError: assert '122323' == None
E        +  where None = <bound method PhoneBook.lookup of <test_pytest_phonebook.PhoneBook object at 0x7fea36fdb2d0>>('Bob')
E        +    where <bound method PhoneBook.lookup of <test_pytest_phonebook.PhoneBook object at 0x7fea36fdb2d0>> = <test_pytest_phonebook.PhoneBook object at 0x7fea36fdb2d0>.lookup
```

`pytest` gives interesting details about the test failure. First of all, It prints the source code of the test case which has failed. Then it highlights the statement which caused the failure. And the following is the detailed analysis of the failure of assert statement.

`pytest` is working really hard under the covers to find out where the assertion failed. It is doing some clever byte code manipulation.

Adding some more tests and functionality :

```
import pytest


class PhoneBook:
    def __init__(self):
        self.numbers = {}

    def add(self, name, number):
        self.numbers[name] = number

    def lookup(self, name):
        return self.numbers[name]

    def names(self):
        return set(self.numbers.keys())


def test_lookup_by_name():
    phonebook = PhoneBook()
    phonebook.add("Bob", "122323")
    assert "122323" == phonebook.lookup("Bob")


def test_phonebook_contains_all_names():
    phonebook = PhoneBook()
    phonebook.add("Bob", "123223")
    assert "Bob" in phonebook.names()


def test_missing_name_raises_error():
    phonebook = PhoneBook()
    with pytest.raises(KeyError):
        phonebook.lookup("Bob")
```

Since `pytest` uses the in-build `assert` construct. There are different types of asserts you can use in your test cases. Note the use of context manager `pytest.raises(<Error>)` to test that the indented lines of code must throw an `Error Exception`. 

## Pytest Fixtures

The way fixtures work in pytest is completely different from the unittest module.

The test case will indicate that it needs some kind of resource or test fixture by specifying arguments to the test function. Pytest will then go and look for a function with the same name of the resource decorated with `@pytest.fixture` decorator. Then at runtime, pytest will hook the return value of the fixture function in the test function. It is kind of a dependency injection. The test just declares 'I am going to need a resource' but it doesn't need to know where it comes from.

The above `test_phonebook.py` with fixtures looks like - 

```
@pytest.fixture
def phonebook():
    return PhoneBook()


def test_lookup_by_name(phonebook):
    phonebook.add("Bob", "122323")
    assert "122323" == phonebook.lookup("Bob")


def test_phonebook_contains_all_names(phonebook):
    phonebook.add("Bob", "123223")
    assert "Bob" in phonebook.names()


def test_missing_name_raises_error(phonebook):
    with pytest.raises(KeyError):
        phonebook.lookup("Bob")
```

The resource `phonebook` gets initiated and hooked to each test case separately. 

Suppose the `PhoneBook` class uses a file as a cache. 

```
class PhoneBook:
    def __init__(self):
        self.numbers = {}
        self.filename = "phonebook.txt"
        self.cache = open(self.filename, "w")

    def clear(self):
        self.cache.close()
        os.remove("self.filename")
```

Now running the above tests will create the file `phonebook.txt` file. It would make sense to delete this file after each test case gets exercised. To do that we will have to use a `tearDown` like feature. In pytest fixtures, you can clear resources simply by replacing `return` in the fixture function with a `yield`. And then add the statements to clear the resources after yield.

```
@pytest.fixture
def phonebook():
    phonebook = PhoneBook()
    yield phonebook
    phonebook.clear()
```
Now the file `phonebook.txt` will also be cleaned after the tests get executed.

It would be more realistic if `PhoneBook` uses a temporary cache directory to create the cache file `phonebook.txt`.

```
class PhoneBook:
    def __init__(self, cacheDirectory):
        self.numbers = {}
        self.filename = "phonebook.txt"
        self.cache = open(os.path.join(cacheDirectory, self.filename), "w")
```

Lets use the pytest built-in fixture `tmpdir`  to pass the temporary directory as an argument to the `PhoneBook` constructor. 

```
@pytest.fixture
def phonebook(tmpdir):
    return PhoneBook(tmpdir)
```

Now when you run the test, `PhoneBook` will use the temporary directory passed by `pytest` and create the cache file `phonebook.txt`. And after the test is run, pytest will delete the temporary directory. This makes our text fixture considerably simpler.

What we have done here exactly is defined a test fixture that uses another test fixture. We defined the fixture `phonebook`  which uses the built-in fixture `tmpdir`. It is a concise syntax to get pretty powerful dependency injection. 

## Organising Testcode

**Physical Structure** : There has to be a clean way of organising test code in a big project.

**Runtime Structure** :  Controlling which tests to run.
