## Why use doctest ?
- **Doctstring Maintenance** : doctest helps in maintaining output examples included in the docstring and verifying them thus making sure that they are up to date with the code.
- **Regression Testing**
- **Tutorial documentation**

A docstring is the standard way to document modules, classes, methodes and functions. It often useful to have a code example embedded in the docstring to illustrate how to use your code. 

    def multiply(a, b):    
    """
    >>> multiply(4, 3)
    12
    >>> multiply('a', 3)
    'aaa'
    """
    
    return  a *  b

With new changes in your code, it is likely that you will forget to update the code examples in the docstring. The doctest will help in keeping these examples up to date with the code by verifying their output. 

## Yatzy score example

Lets write a small function to calculate the yatzy score of a dice in the `small straight` category. 

    def small_straight(dice):
        """Score the given roll in the 'small straight category'
    
        >>> small_straight([1,2,3,4,5])
        15
        >>> small_straight([1,2,3,4,1])
        0
    
        """
    
        if dice == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
            return sum(dice)
        return 0

Note the code examples in the docstring as well. Now running `python -m pytest --doctest-modules` will run this code example as a test and report as passed or failed. 

## Handling output that changes

The function under testing could return an output that changes every time it is called. For example it could return date/time, object ID, random number. There are some standard ways to handle this varying output.

Varying outputs like objectID can be handled using `ELLIPSIS` directive. The following example uses wildcard for the object ID.

    def driver0(value, index):
        value = value[index]
        return value
    
    
    def driver1(value, index):
        value = value[0] << 16 | (value[1])
        return value
    
    
    def driver2(value, index):
        value = struct.unpack('f', struct.pack('<HH', value[0], value[1]))[0]
        return value
    
    
    def get_all_drivers():
        """Returns all drivers
    
        >>> get_all_drivers() #doctest +ELLIPSIS
        [(0, <function driver0 at 0x...>), (1, <function driver1 at 0x...>), (2, <function driver2 at 0x...>)]
        """
    
        drivers = []
        for driver in range(0, 3):
            drivers.append((driver, globals()[F"driver{driver}"]))
        return drivers

But the thing with wildcards is that they often match more than they are expected to. And so the tests pass if they should have been failed. The following example adds a new driver function but still the test gets passed. 

    
    
    def driver3(value, index):
	    value = struct.unpack('>f', struct.pack('>HH', value[0], value[1]))[0]
	    return value
    
    def get_all_drivers():
        """Returns all drivers
    
        >>> get_all_drivers() #doctest +ELLIPSIS
        [(0, <function driver0 at 0x...>), (1, <function driver1 at 0x...>), (2, <function driver2 at 0x...>)]
        """
    
        drivers = []
        for driver in range(0, 4):
            drivers.append((driver, globals()[F"driver{driver}"]))
        return drivers

There will be 4 drivers in the output list but the doctest only involves 3. This test should have been failed but the wildcard matches more than what it was meant to match thus making the test passed which could be dangerous.

This brings us to the second way of dealing with varying outputs. We can always change the form the code example we include in the docstring by somehow making it independent of the objectID.

    def get_all_drivers():
        """Returns all drivers
    
        >>> [(driverNumber,driverFunction.__name__) for driverNumber,driverFunction in get_all_drivers()]
        [(0, 'driver0'), (1, 'driver1'), (2, 'driver2'), (3, 'driver3')]
        """
    
        drivers = []
        for driver in range(0, 4):
            drivers.append((driver, globals()[F"driver{driver}"]))
        return drivers

The bonus of the above method is cleaner and more meaningful code example in the docstring.

### Doctest in case of random numbers
The idea here is to use seed so that everytime the output doesn't vary.


    def roll(numberOfDice=5):
        """Roll the indicated number of 6 sided dice using a random number
        generator.
        
        >>> random.seed(1233)
        >>> roll()
        [2, 3, 3, 3, 5]
        """
    
        return sorted(
            random.choice([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) for i in range(numberOfDice))

### Handling tracebacks

    def dice_counts(dice):
        """Returns dictionary of how many of each value are in dice
        >>> dice_counts([1,2,3,4,2])
        {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 0, 6: 0}
    
        >>> dice_counts("12234")
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: must be str, not int
        """
        return {x: dice.count(x) for x in range(1, 7)}

To ignore exception message use the doctest directive  `+IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL`

    def dice_counts(dice):
        """Returns dictionary of how many of each value are in dice
        >>> dice_counts([1,2,3,4,2])
        {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 0, 6: 0}
    
        >>> dice_counts("12234") #doctest: +IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        TypeError: Can't convert 'int' object to str implicitly
        """
        return {x: dice.count(x) for x in range(1, 7)}
