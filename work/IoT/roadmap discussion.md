## Known-Knowns

- Reliability
	- Software Reliability
		- Code Optimisation
		- Query transaction 
		- Bottlenecks in terms of data and commands reliability
	- SSD unmount

## Known-unknowns

- Modularity
	- Reliability gained to modularity
- Issues in previous Rpi System
	- Improvements in the new system
- Scalability
	- Load Requirements ?
		- Should we implement load balancer for Joule Recipes ? or should we give the access to the user which controller to deploy the recipe ? or no need to do anything ?
- Hardware agnostic
