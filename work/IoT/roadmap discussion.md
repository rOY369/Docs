## Known-unknowns

- Modularity
	- Reliability gained to modularity
- Issues in previous Rpi System
	- Improvements in the new system
- Scalability
	- Requirements ?
		- Should we implement load balancer for Joule Recipes ? or should we give the access to the user which controller to deploy the recipe ?
