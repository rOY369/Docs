## Why Software Architecture ? 

**The lack of architecture bonds the organisation or the team inescapably to its past.**
-	Our legacy : Haphazard systems
-	These systems are expensive and hard to change.
-	Drag 
	-	Long and unpredictable development times. 
	-	Ambiguous behaviour 
	-	Unable to adapt to the environment

**Organisational Purpose**
- Communicating high-level design to stakeholders, tech-support, quality assurance and even customers.
	- Even large and complex architectures can be conveyed using presentation slides and documented using an A4. 
- Providing system context for developers and future maintainers 
- Work Allocation 
	- Decomposed system into substructures that are relatively independent with clear responsibilities and limited number of well-defined interfaces to communicate

**Technical Purpose**
- Meet system requirements and objectives
- Enable flexible distribution/partitioning of the system 
- Reduce cost of maintenance and evolution
	- Anticipating main kinds of changes that will occur in the system at the architecture level, ensuring the design will facilitate such changes.
	- And localising as far as possible the effects of such changes on design documents, code and other parts of the system. 
- Increase reuse and integration with third-party software. 

**Disorder is easier and more permanent than order, which is **

## What is Software Architecture ? 

*All architecture is design but not all design is architecture.*
*The significant design decisions that shape a system, where significant is measured by cost of change.*
*It is mainly spending more time on the whiteboard, diagrams, maps and models before hitting the keyboard. *

**Cost of change**
- Time 
- Energy
- Mental Stress
- Satisfaction 

**Decision Template**
- **Title** :
	- Short Phrase
	- Up-front design approach in software development
- **Context** : 
	- Describe the forces at play probably in tension 
	- Every now and then, we realise that the quality of our software does not meet the standards. In order to create a modular, adaptable, clean and robust system we need to change the way we approach development. 
- **Decision** : 
	- Describe our response to the forces. 
	- Adapt and switch to a more disciplined approach like up-front design. 
- **Status** :
	- Proposed
- **Consequences**
	- Describe the resulting context after applying the decision.
