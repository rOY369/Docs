## Why Software Architecture ? 

**The lack of architecture bonds the organisation or the team inescapably to its past.**
-	Our legacy : Haphazard systems
-	These systems are expensive and hard to change.
-	Drag 
	-	Long and unpredictable development times. 
	-	Ambiguous behaviour 
	-	Unable to adapt to the environment

**Organisational Purpose**
- Communicating high-level design to stakeholders, tech-support, quality assurance and even customers.
	- Even large and complex architectures can be conveyed using presentation slides and documented using an A4. 
- Providing system context for developers and future maintainers 
- Work Allocation 
	- Decomposed system into substructures that are relatively independent with clear responsibilities and limited number of well-defined interfaces to communicate

**Technical Purpose**
- Meet system requirements and objectives
