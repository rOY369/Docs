## Why Software Architecture ? 

**The lack of architecture bonds the organisation or the team inescapably to its past.**
-	Our legacy : Haphazard systems
-	These systems are expensive and hard to change.
-	Drag 
	-	Long and unpredictable development times. 
	-	Ambiguous behaviour 
	-	Unable to adapt to the environment

**Organisational Purpose**
- Communicating high-level design to stakeholders
