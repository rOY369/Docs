## Outcome 

The successful implementation of this zero_waste action plan means that the following outcomes are achieved
- Divert 90% of our solid waste from landfills either through recycling, composting, reusing or other methods.
- Get a green certificate from a certified waste management consultant. 
 
## Basis of Action Plan 

Each solution in the zero_waste action plan has to go through the following checks :
- Is the solution absolutely required ? 
- Is it easy to integrate into our lives ? 
- Is it economically viable ?
- Is it super-satisfying to use ? 

It will cover the following types of waste - `paper`, `water`, `electricity`

**Note** : Economically viable does not mean cheap solutions. The solution and its output together will be taken into account. All factors (installation, usage, maintenance, output etc.) will be evaluated to calculate cost-efficiency. 

## How ? 

We need an action plan in each waste category that 
- takes care of the existing waste problems immediately by deploying easy and economical solutions.
- sets up a culture of sustainability by regular training, knowledge share and positive influence. 
- involves tracking of our daily consumption.
- guides us consistently towards more sustainable waste management process and practices over the long term. 

**Action Plan**

- Immediate Necessary Action
	- Solutions that are absolutely required right now. 
- Other effective solutions that can be discussed upon and deployed. 
	- Research other effective solutions to reduce consumption or better manage waste. 
	- These ideas will then be discussed upon. 
	- If found viable, these will be deployed. 
- Awareness 
	- Positive influence through Training, JouleTALKS and creative learning methods. 
- Monitoring and Measuring our consumption and waste  
- Collaboration with Waste Management Consultants

### Paper Waste

**Immediate Action**

- Tissues : Use of napkins, toilet rolls and face tissues. 
	- Toilet rolls in the washroom and tissues in the kitchen can be replaced by Bamboo based tissues [https://letsbeco.com/](https://letsbeco.com/)
		- Bamboo based tissues are greener than regular tissues. Bamboo is a crop and not a tree. Bamboo grows 5 times faster than any other crop, requires one-third the amount of water than any other alternative like cotton. 
		- 100% natural and plant based. 
		- Eco-friendly packaging
		- Affordable
	- Tissue paper dispenser in washroom to be replaced with hand dryer. 
		- More hygienic. Dry tissue papers have the probability of having harmful bacteria and germs. 
		- Bad scenario - no tissue paper. 
		- The average cost per use for a hand dryer is a measly Rs 0.05 as compared to a paper
dispenserâ€™s Rs 0.30. 
- Ideal Printer settings and policy
	- Turn on paper saving features in the priner

**Other possible solutions to be evaluated**
- Business Cards
